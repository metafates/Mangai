## Configuration

Mangal uses [TOML](https://toml.io) format for configuration under the `mangal.toml` filename.
Config is expected to be at the OS default config directory.
For example, on Linux it would be `~/.config/mangal/mangal.toml`.

Run `mangal where` to show expected config paths

> "But what if I want to specify my own config path?"
> 
> Okay, fine, use env variable `MANGAL_CONFIG_PATH`

Run `mangal config init` to generate a default config file

> This is not a complete config, just an example.
```toml
# mangal.toml

[downloader]
# Name template of the downloaded chapters
# Available variables:
# {index}        - index of the chapters
# {padded-index} - same as index but padded with leading zeros
# {chapter}      - name of the chapter
chapter_name_template = '[{padded-index}] {chapter}'

# Where to download manga
# Absolute or relative.
#
# You can also use home variable 
# Linux/macOS = $HOME or ~
# Windows = %USERPROFILE%
path = '.'



[formats]
# Default format to export chapters
# Available options are: pdf, zip, cbz, plain
use = 'pdf'



[history]
# Save chapters to history when downloaded
save_on_download = false
# Save chapters to history on read
save_on_read = true



[icons]
# Icons variant.
# Available options are: emoji, kaomoji, plain, nerd (nerd-font)
variant = 'emoji'



[mangadex]
# Preffered language
language = 'en'
# Show nsfw manga/chapters
nsfw = false
# Show chapters that cannot be read (because they are hosted on a different site)
show_unavailable_chapters = false



[mini]
# Show bye message
bye = true
# Use vim binds to move
vim_mode = true



[reader]
# Name of the app to use as a reader. Will use default OS app if empty
name = ''
# Will open chapter in the browser instead of downloading it
read_in_browser = false

[logs]
# write logs?
write = false
# Available options are: (from less to most verbose)
# panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace
level = "info"
```

## Custom scrapers

Mangal has a Lua5.1 VM built-in + some useful libraries, such as headless chrome, http client, html parser and so on...

Check the [defined modules](luamodules) for more information.

For scraper examples, check the [mangal-scrapers repository](https://github.com/metafates/mangal-scrapers)

_Okay, so, how do I add a custom scraper?_

1. Create a new lua file in the `mangal where --sources` folder
2. Filename will be used as a source name
3. Your script __must__ contain __3__ essential functions
   - `SearchManga(query)` - must return a table of tables each having 2 fields `name` and `url`
   - `MangaChapters(mangalUrl)` - must return a table of tables each having 2 fields `name` and `url` _(again)_
   - `ChapterPages(chapterUrl)` - must return a table of tables each having 2 fields `index` _(for ordering)_ and `url` _(to download image)_
4. __That's it!__ You can test it by running `mangal run ...` where `...` is a filename

## Anilist

Mangal also supports integration with anilist.

It will mark chapters as read on Anilsit when you read them inside mangal.

For more information see [wiki](https://github.com/metafates/mangal/wiki/Anilist-Integration)

> Maybe I'll add more sites in the future, like [myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/). Open to suggestions!
